## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project explores the training of a miniaturized GPT model (BabyGPT) using [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Training on Shakespeare text** to learn basic language modeling.
2. **Architecture exploration** by varying attention heads while keeping layers fixed.
3. **Training on custom C/C++ code** to explore BabyGPT's ability to learn programming patterns.
